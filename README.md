# MSLockscreenImageGrabber
Simple python script which copies the images from the Microsoft Lockscreen Wallpaper Directory in AppData, appends them with ".jpg" and places them in a directory of the user's choosing to use as a desktop wallpaper.

This can be setup as a service in Windows to grab the wallaper's daily upon startup or login.
